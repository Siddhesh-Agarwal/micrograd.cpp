# micrograd.cpp

A C++ version of [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd library](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). The goal is to provide a simple, efficient but complete implementation of the micrograd library in C++.

## Features

The file contains 2 header files:
1. nn.hpp: Contains the neural network implementation. Equivalent to the [micrograd/nn.py](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/micrograd/nn.py) file in the original repository.
2. engine.hpp: Contains the engine implementation. Equivalent to the [micrograd/engine.py](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/micrograd/engine.py) file in the original repository.
